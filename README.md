# Python API Integration Project (weather.py)

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in creating a communication interface with an external API using Python. Students will learn how to make HTTP requests, handle API responses, and work with data retrieved from the API.

### Requirements:

1. Basic knowledge of Python programming.
2. Familiarity with HTTP concepts (GET and POST requests).
3. Understanding of JSON data format.

   
### Task Description:
In this project, students will develop a Python program that communicates with a chosen public API. You can let the students select an API of their choice, but some suggestions include:

- Weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
-  RESTful APIs for a social media platform (e.g., Twitter or Reddit)
-  Currency exchange rate API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates)
-  Public transportation data (e.g., using Google Maps API)

# Finance Calculator App

### Objective: 
Create a Python application that allows users to perform basic financial calculations. The application should use functions to handle various financial operations such as interest rate calculations, loan payments, and savings projections.

### Requirements:

1) Create functions for the following financial calculations:
- Calculate Simple Interest
- Calculate Compound Interest
- Calculate Loan Payment (using the formula for monthly loan payments)
- Calculate Future Value of a Savings Account (with regular contributions)

2) Implement a main menu function called main_menu() that displays the following options:
- Calculate Simple Interest
- Calculate Compound Interest
- Calculate Loan Payment
- Calculate Future Value of Savings
- Quit the application

3) Allow users to input their choice (e.g., 1 for Simple Interest) and the required parameters (e.g., principal, rate, time) for the selected financial calculation.
4) Call the appropriate function based on the user's choice and display the result.
5) Ensure proper error handling for cases like division by zero or invalid input.
6) Use appropriate financial formulas for calculations.
7) Include user-friendly prompts and error messages.
