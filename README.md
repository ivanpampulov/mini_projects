# Python API Integration Project

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to provide students with hands-on experience in creating a communication interface with an external API using Python. Students will learn how to make HTTP requests, handle API responses, and work with data retrieved from the API.

### Requirements:

1. Basic knowledge of Python programming.
2. Familiarity with HTTP concepts (GET and POST requests).
3. Understanding of JSON data format.

   
### Task Description:
In this project, students will develop a Python program that communicates with a chosen public API. You can let the students select an API of their choice, but some suggestions include:

- Weather data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)
-  RESTful APIs for a social media platform (e.g., Twitter or Reddit)
-  Currency exchange rate API (e.g., Open Exchange Rates)
-  Public transportation data (e.g., using Google Maps API)
